### We're building a fighting simulator with a backend to support it.
We'll be representing the leaderboard via a persistent table that will be constantly updated as battles progress. Entrants will be randomly generated and added to the participants or fighter table as needed. A backend API will pull participants and simulate a fight between the two. The loser dies, the winner gets ELO and rises in the leaderboards. 

We plan to add more functionality like a seperate weapons table from which participants can acquire weapons.

#### MVP:
- add entrants
- simulate fighting
- maintain a leaderboard


### Contributers
- David Voronov
- Aiden King
