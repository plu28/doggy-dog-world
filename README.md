### We're building an API for a betting game with simulated fighting.
Players will join an active game and be given money. In addition to being given money on join, they will also be able to create an entrant to fight other players' entrants. Every round will be composed of a set of matches where players will bet on which entrant they think will win. A winner will be selected, and then play will continue. Entrants will fight tourney style until one reigns supreme. Player's final money amounts will be displayed on a persistent leaderboard.

### Generating Entrants
When a player joins a game, they will be able to generate an entrant to add to the bracket. They will do this by supplying a name and weapon.
  
### Matches
During a match, players bet on which of the two entrants they think will win the fight. A winner will then be randomly selected. The probability of an entrant winning a fight will be proportional to the percentage of bets on that entrant for that round. ChatGPT will then create a short story describing the fight.

### User interaction
- Users will be able to create accounts on our platform and then bet on fights using virtual currency
- A seperate leaderboard of the best betters with the most money will be maintained along with their win loss ratios and streaks.
- Users will be able to see their history.

### Potential added functionality
- Rather than having selected weapons and characters, users can create a list of characters and weapons. They will then be able to create a character-weapon combination from a set of characters and weapons randomly selected from other users.

#### MVP:
- add entrants
- place bets and win fights
- maintain a leaderboard
